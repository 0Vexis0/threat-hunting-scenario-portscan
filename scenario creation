Threat Event (Unauthorized Network Reconnaissance)

PowerShell-Based Internal Port Scanning Activity

Environment Preparation (Defender Onboarding)

Before any suspicious activity occurred, the workstation cybernecromancy was properly onboarded into Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) to ensure full telemetry collection. The onboarding was performed as part of a controlled lab environment to capture realistic process, file, and network events for analysis.

Simulated Adversary Activity (Log & IoC Generation)

After onboarding was complete, a simulated unauthorized activity was performed to generate detectable indicators:

A valid local user account (cybermaster) logged into the device.

A custom PowerShell script named portscan.ps1 was present on the system.

The script was executed to perform internal network scanning against hosts in the 10.0.0.0/24 range.

The script attempted connections to multiple common and well-known service ports in sequential order.

Repeated failed connection attempts were generated against both the local system and another internal host.

Scan activity was logged locally to C:\ProgramData\entropygorilla.log.

The activity produced abnormal network, process, and file telemetry suitable for threat hunting validation
